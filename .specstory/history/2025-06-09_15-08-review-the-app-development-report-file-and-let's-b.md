Review the App development report file and let's begin building the app.

I'll review the Bridge Crane Inspection App development report and help you begin building the application. Let me first examine the current workspace structure and then analyze the report details. Based on my review of the comprehensive Bridge Crane Inspection App Development Report, I can see this is an ambitious project to create an AI-enhanced crane inspection platform. The report outlines:

## Key Project Details:
- **Technology Stack**: Tauri + Rust backend, Svelte frontend
- **Timeline**: 9 phases over 48 weeks
- **Budget**: $640,000
- **Core Features**: AI-powered defect detection, predictive maintenance, compliance management
- **Standards**: OSHA 1910.179, ASME B30.2, CMAA Specification 75

## Next Steps - Let's Start Building!

Based on the report's Phase 1 (Planning and Architecture), let's begin by setting up the project foundation. I'll help you create the initial Tauri-Svelte application structure. Let me create the project structure directly in your current workspace: Let me fix the PowerShell command: Great! The Tauri template has been created. Now let's set up the Rust toolchain and continue with the setup: Perfect! Now let's examine the created project structure: Let's check if Rust is installed and install it if needed: We need to install Rust. Let's do that: Excellent! Rust has been successfully installed. Now let's update the PATH and check if everything is working: Let me update the PATH environment variable manually: Perfect! Now let's try to run the Tauri development server: Let's check the status of the development server: The development server is starting. Let's wait a moment and check again: Great! The application is compiling and starting up. Let's wait a bit more for it to fully initialize: The application is downloading and compiling dependencies. This may take a few minutes for the first time. While we wait, let me examine the project structure and start customizing it for the Bridge Crane Inspection App: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
